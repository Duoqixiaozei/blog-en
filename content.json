Its success in the early days of the smartphone era stemmed from strategic partnerships and high-value offerings. However, the company’s lack of innovation, strategic missteps, and fierce competition led to a steady decline in its market share. This article explores Coolpad’s meteoric rise, its financial struggles, and the challenges it faces as it seeks to reinvent itself. Image Source: Antutu 1. From Budget King to Market Decline: Coolpad’s JourneyCoolpad achieved significant success in the early smartphone market, particularly in the low- and mid-tier segments. Its affordable “budget phones” captured the attention of cost-conscious consumers. Below are some key factors contributing to Coolpad’s initial success: 1.1 Competitive Pricing and the Budget Phone StrategyCoolpad’s focus on affordable devices made it a favorite among budget-conscious users, particularly in smaller cities. Despite their lower price points, Coolpad devices offered competitive hardware specifications. 1.2 Partnerships with Telecom OperatorsCoolpad collaborated with telecom giants like China Mobile to offer carrier-branded, customized smartphones. This partnership helped Coolpad penetrate rural markets and second-tier cities, building a robust user base. 1.3 Market Share GrowthBetween 2014 and 2016, Coolpad held a significant portion of the market, with its share peaking at over 10%. However, the rise of competitors and Coolpad’s slower pace of innovation gradually eroded its position. 2. The Fall of a Giant: Declining Market ShareAs competition intensified and innovation lagged, Coolpad’s market share steadily declined. Below is a table illustrating Coolpad’s market share trends: Year Domestic Market Share Key Drivers of Change 2015 10% Dominated the budget phone segment through partnerships with carriers. 2016 9% Faced increased competition; innovation began to lag. 2017 7% Rivals like Huawei, Xiaomi, and OPPO gained traction. 2018 4% Struggled to adapt to emerging 5G and AI technologies. 2019 2% Brand recognition faded; lacked online channel presence. 2020 1% Nearly exited the domestic market. 2021 0.5% Shifted focus to real estate and leasing. 3. Financial Struggles: Narrowing Losses but Dim ProspectsCoolpad’s financial health remains precarious despite recent cost-cutting measures. The table below summarizes Coolpad’s financial data from 2022 to mid-2024: Year Net Loss (HKD) Gross Profit/Loss (HKD) Key Revenue Sources 2022 -625M -5M Smartphone sales, carrier contracts. 2023 -225M +100M Asset sales, real estate leases. 2024 (H1) -95M +120M Land sales, property leasing. Key Insights: Losses Narrow but Persist: Coolpad’s net losses have steadily decreased, but the company remains in financial trouble. Recent improvements largely stem from cost reductions and a pivot to low-cost e-commerce strategies. Reliance on Asset Liquidation: Much of Coolpad’s revenue comes from selling land and non-core assets, a strategy that offers temporary relief but fails to provide sustainable growth. 4. Missed Opportunities and Competitive PressuresSeveral factors contributed to Coolpad’s market decline: Lagging Innovation: Coolpad failed to keep pace with advancements in 4G, 5G, and AI technologies, leaving it behind competitors like Xiaomi and Huawei. Ineffective Transition: Although Coolpad diversified into real estate and leasing, it did not rejuvenate its smartphone business. Fierce Competition: Brands such as Huawei, OPPO, and Vivo expanded aggressively, leveraging innovation and robust marketing strategies. 5. Can Coolpad Stage a Comeback?While Coolpad’s current situation appears grim, there is potential for a revival if the company adopts bold strategies: Focus on Innovation: Investments in 5G, AI, and IoT technologies could create differentiation and new market opportunities. Rebrand for Younger Audiences: Strategic marketing campaigns targeting younger consumers could revitalize Coolpad’s brand image. Strengthen E-commerce Channels: Collaborating with major e-commerce platforms could boost Coolpad’s visibility and sales. Diversify Revenue Streams: Expanding into IoT and smart home markets could provide new growth avenues. ConclusionCoolpad’s transformation from a budget phone giant to a struggling player is a cautionary tale of missed opportunities and the importance of innovation. While its market share and finances paint a challenging picture, strategic changes could help Coolpad rediscover its relevance in the ever-evolving tech industry.

This issue can be confusing, especially after you believe the domain and IP are no longer linked. Below, we will explore some of the common reasons for this behavior and how to fix it. Possible Causes and Solutions 1. Incomplete IP Binding Removal by the Domain Service ProviderSometimes, the domain service provider may not have fully removed the binding between your domain and the IP address. In this case, the IP may still be associated with the domain name. Solution: Double-check with your domain service provider and make sure all bindings to that IP address have been completely removed. 2. Domain Name Service Provider Cache Not ClearedIf the cache of your domain service provider hasn’t been cleared, the redirection issue may persist, causing the IP address to still point to the domain. Solution: Contact your service provider and request them to clear their cache. Alternatively, you may need to wait for the DNS cache to expire naturally. 3. Server URL Rewrite Rules Not UpdatedThe server’s URL rewrite rules (e.g., in Nginx or Apache .htaccess files) might still redirect the IP address to the domain, even after unbinding. Solution: Update or remove any URL rewrite rules in your server configuration to stop redirection to the domain name. Example: Checking and Tuning Settings with CloudflareIf you’re using Cloudflare, here are steps to ensure your IP address no longer redirects to the domain: Check DNS Records: Log into Cloudflare and go to the DNS Records page. Ensure that there are no other domains bound to your server’s IP address. Delete any unnecessary records. Clear Cache: Navigate to Cache → Configuration → Clear Cache and select Clear All. This will ensure that Cloudflare’s cache is cleared, preventing old redirect behavior. Update Nginx Configuration: Open your Nginx configuration file and ensure the domain name binding has been updated to reflect the correct IP address. This step will make sure that the IP URL opens properly without redirecting. Note: The above solutions assume your public IP address has port 80 open for web traffic. By addressing these potential issues, you can prevent unwanted redirection and ensure that your IP address points to the correct content.","categories":[{"name":"Website","slug":"Website","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/categories/Website/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Website, DNS, IP Address, Domain, Redirect","slug":"Website-DNS-IP-Address-Domain-Redirect","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/tags/Website-DNS-IP-Address-Domain-Redirect/"}]},{"title":"How to connect to a server remotely using SSH in Google Cloud","slug":"Google-Cloud-SSH Remote Tutorials","date":"2024-08-26T02:17:30.000Z","updated":"2024-09-25T03:25:30.951Z","comments":true,"path":"Google-Cloud-SSH Remote Tutorials/","link":"","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/Google-Cloud-SSH%20Remote%20Tutorials/","excerpt":"Open this URL https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.htmlFind puttygen.exe (a RSA and DSA key generation utility), if you can’t find it, you can just Ctrl + F and type puttygen.exe (a RSA and DSA key generation utility).will automatically jump to the information you are looking for, for example, my is the chrome browser search is orange to remind the target found Find your corresponding computer architecture type download x86 on download x86","text":"Open this URL https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.htmlFind puttygen.exe (a RSA and DSA key generation utility), if you can’t find it, you can just Ctrl + F and type puttygen.exe (a RSA and DSA key generation utility).will automatically jump to the information you are looking for, for example, my is the chrome browser search is orange to remind the target found Find your corresponding computer architecture type download x86 on download x86 Download and open the software to enter Click Generate (tips: after clicking do not switch to other programs and wait a while to switch to other programs it will not move!)Generate a good need to add the information in front of the Gmail in the Key comment @ in front of, for example, mine is rsa-key-20240826test (in addition to your gmail in front of the information, For example my email is :test@gmail.com @ in front of, for example, test you directly add the back on the line) Then click Save private Key to save it to the folder you want.Then open your Google cloud Computer Engine and click “Metadata” in Settings and then click SSH secret key.Copy all the contents of puttygen’s Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized keys file: into the private key.

This can harm your site’s SEO performance and user experience. In this article, we’ll explore common causes of redirection issues and how to solve them. 1. Binding Multiple Domains to One SiteOne common cause of redirection issues is when multiple domain names are bound to the same website. Here’s how to fix it: Solution: Go to your DNS service provider and remove the unnecessary domain binding. For instance, if you have both www.yourdomain.com and yourdomain.com bound to the same site, choose one (usually www.yourdomain.com) to be the primary binding. You can set this up using a CNAME or A record. 2. Incorrect DNS ConfigurationAnother possible cause is incorrect DNS settings. This can prevent search engines from properly indexing your site and cause unnecessary redirects. Solution: Ensure that the DNS records for your server are correctly configured. If you’re hosting your site on GitHub Pages, create a CNAME file in the root directory of your repository with your domain name, such as www.yourdomain.com. Upload the file to complete the configuration. 3. HTTPS and SSL Certificate IssuesOne of the most important factors in modern SEO is ensuring your site uses HTTPS. If your site doesn’t have a valid SSL certificate, it can trigger redirects or display security warnings. Solution: Make sure your site is using HTTPS by obtaining an SSL certificate. You can get a free SSL certificate by hosting your domain on Cloudflare, which also provides CDN services. Alternatively, you can purchase an SSL certificate from your domain registrar or hosting provider. By addressing these common issues, you can resolve SEO redirection problems, improve user experience, and boost your search engine rankings.","categories":[{"name":"SEO","slug":"SEO","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/categories/SEO/"}],"tags":[{"name":"SEO, Redirection, Domain, HTTPS, SSL","slug":"SEO-Redirection-Domain-HTTPS-SSL","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/tags/SEO-Redirection-Domain-HTTPS-SSL/"}]},{"title":"My Journey into Linux","slug":"Record my entry into linux","date":"2024-08-01T09:39:17.000Z","updated":"2024-10-11T02:17:37.258Z","comments":true,"path":"Record my entry into linux/","link":"","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/Record%20my%20entry%20into%20linux/","excerpt":"My First Experience with LinuxWhen did you first dive into Linux?

Building a website? For me, it all started when I heard the story of Linus Torvalds as a kid. I was watching a video on B-site where the uploader was explaining Linux, and that piqued my interest. Later, I bought a book called Bird Brother’s Private Kitchen to learn more, but after a while, I stopped. Maybe the commands were too boring, or maybe I just didn’t like it. Linux lacked the convenience of Windows’ point-and-click interface, and I struggled with it at first. Back then, I spent most of my time tinkering with virtual machines in VMware. Downloading an ISO was a slow process, but once I got it, I set up my first Linux virtual machine. I remember when I first started searching for Linux distributions, Ubuntu popped up everywhere. I installed it out of curiosity. Ubuntu’s desktop wasn’t as user-friendly as it is now, and there were still a few compatibility issues. Gnome was fine, but if you’re using a laptop, I’d recommend KDE for its better performance. The first few Linux commands I learned were simple: cd, cp, mkdir, and touch. Those were easy to understand. But then came more complex ones like ls -al and chmod for managing file permissions — these took more time to master. At the time, I was just in junior high school, and I had even bought a Raspberry Pi. Funny enough, I sold it last year and got almost the same price I paid! A High School Encounter with LinuxIn high school, I met someone interested in game development, who is still pursuing that path today. He was a real pro back then — compiling Linux, running Docker on a Xiaomi phone, and even setting up Windows to run on it. I was amazed by his skills, especially since he participated in national competitions. As for me, I didn’t get serious with Linux until much later, during my university years. I was more focused on having fun back then. Only recently did I start working with Linux again, setting up cloud servers and installing CentOS — no graphical interface, just this: The Linux Struggle: Trial and ErrorI can spend all day working with Linux now, though progress sometimes feels slow. Google and Baidu became my best friends, as I constantly looked up errors and issues I encountered. Most of the problems were due to downloading software from external sources without using domestic mirrors, leading to many 404 errors and failed installations. It was frustrating, but also a learning process. I also came across some dangerous commands, like the infamous rm -rf. This command forcefully deletes files without warning, and running it can wipe out your entire system if you’re not careful! Linux in Everyday LifeYou might think you’re far from Linux, but in reality, it’s everywhere — from underground metro systems to servers, Android devices, embedded systems, robotics, big data, and AI. Linux is the backbone of so much modern technology, and the more I work with it, the more I realize its importance. Linux has been a journey for me, from curiosity to frustration, and now to appreciation. I’m still learning, but I’ve come a long way from my first virtual machine experience.

In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to download, configure, and use Putty for Linux. Whether you’re accessing a server on your LAN or a remote server, these instructions will help you get set up quickly. Downloading PuttyIf you’re not sure where to download Putty, you can click here to download Putty. Choose the version that corresponds to your operating system. For example, if you’re using Windows 64-bit, download the Windows 64-bit version. Once downloaded, simply open the file to start using Putty. Setting Up Your Server Connection in Putty Input your server’s IP address into the Hostname field. By default, you’ll connect over port 22 for SSH access. For demonstration purposes, I’m using 192.168.1.1, which is a LAN IP address. Make sure to enter your actual server IP address. Before you click Open, let’s configure a few more settings to improve your connection stability. Keep Your Connection AliveTo avoid disconnection issues, it’s recommended to set a keepalive interval: Navigate to the Connection settings. In the Seconds between keepalives field, set the value to 30. This ensures that your session remains active even if there’s no data being transmitted. Save Your Connection SettingsTo save time in the future, you can save your session details so you don’t have to re-enter your server IP and configurations every time: After setting up your IP and keepalive settings, return to the Session screen. Enter a name for your session in the Saved Sessions field. Click Save. Now, whenever you open Putty, you can simply load your saved session and skip re-entering the connection details. Try using these settings to improve your Putty experience! By following these steps, you’ll ensure a smoother and more reliable SSH connection to your Linux server using Putty. Don’t forget to save your configurations to make future logins quicker!","categories":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/categories/Linux/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/tags/Linux/"}]},{"title":"How to Create an SSH Secret Key on Linux","slug":"Linux Create SSH Secret Key","date":"2024-07-18T07:54:10.000Z","updated":"2024-10-11T02:35:38.592Z","comments":true,"path":"Linux Create SSH Secret Key/","link":"","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/Linux%20Create%20SSH%20Secret%20Key/","excerpt":"How to Create an SSH Secret Key on LinuxCreating an SSH key pair is an essential step for secure remote access to servers.

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of generating an SSH secret key on a Linux system, ensuring that you can connect securely without using passwords. Step-by-Step Guide to Generate an SSH Key Pair Step 1: Open Your TerminalBegin by opening your terminal application on your Linux system. This is where you’ll enter the commands needed to generate your SSH key. Step 2: Generate the SSH Key PairTo create a new SSH key pair, type the following command into your terminal: 1ssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"youremail@email.com\" Make sure to replace “youremail@email.com“ with your actual email address. This email address helps identify your key and can be useful for reference. Step 3: Follow the PromptsAfter entering the command, you will be prompted to provide some information. Simply press Enter to accept the default options for each prompt: 123456Enter the file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):Directory '/root/.ssh' has been created.Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):Enter same passphrase again:Your identity has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. File Location: Press Enter to save the key in the default location (/root/.ssh/id_rsa), or specify a different path if desired. Passphrase: Adding a passphrase increases security. If you prefer not to use one, just press Enter to leave it blank. Step 4: Navigate to the SSH DirectoryOnce the key is generated, navigate to the .ssh directory where your keys are stored: 1cd ~/.ssh Step 5: Display Your Public KeyTo view your newly generated public key, use the cat command: 1cat id_rsa.pub This command will display your public key in the terminal, allowing you to copy it directly for later use. Note: Don’t worry about formatting; simply copy the key as it appears. Step 6: Use Your Public Key for Secure ConnectionsNow that you have your public key, you can add it to your remote server’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. This enables you to connect to your server securely without needing to enter a password each time. ConclusionYou’ve successfully created an SSH secret key on your Linux system! This key pair enhances the security of your remote connections, making it easier to manage your servers without compromising safety. By following these steps, you’ll be well on your way to secure server access using SSH. Always keep your private key secure and consider using SSH config files for easier management of multiple keys and hosts. By implementing these practices, you’ll ensure a robust and secure connection to your remote servers.","categories":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/categories/Linux/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/tags/Linux/"},{"name":"SSH","slug":"SSH","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/tags/SSH/"},{"name":"SSH Key Generation","slug":"SSH-Key-Generation","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/tags/SSH-Key-Generation/"},{"name":"Secure Access","slug":"Secure-Access","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/tags/Secure-Access/"}]},{"title":"How to Use Vim Mastering Copy, Paste, and Deletion in Vim","slug":"How to use the vim (B)","date":"2024-07-17T06:25:05.000Z","updated":"2024-10-11T02:45:44.224Z","comments":true,"path":"How to use the vim (B)/","link":"","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/How%20to%20use%20the%20vim%20(B)/","excerpt":"Vim is a powerful text editor used by developers, but mastering its unique commands can be challenging.

In this guide, we’ll explore how to efficiently copy, paste, and delete lines in Vim, both within and outside the editor. How to Copy and Paste from External Sources in VimWhen working with external sources, you might be tempted to use Ctrl+V to paste content into Vim, but Vim handles pasting differently. Steps to Copy from External Sources: Copy the text from the external source (e.g., another program or terminal). Open Vim and switch to command mode by pressing Esc. Use :+p to paste the copied content into your current file. If you’re using terminal emulators like Putty or Xshell, you can right-click inside the Vim window to directly paste the content without switching modes. How to Copy and Paste Within VimFor copying and pasting within Vim, you can use several built-in commands: To copy a line, simply type yy in normal mode. To paste below the copied line, type p. To paste above, type P (uppercase). You can also copy specific words or sections of a line: Typing yw copies the word under the cursor. Then, typing p pastes the word in the desired location. Copying Multiple LinesTo copy multiple lines, use the following steps: Move the cursor to the first line you want to copy. Type the number of lines followed by yy. For example, 3yy copies the next three lines. How to Delete Lines in VimVim’s delete commands are powerful for removing lines or specific sections of text. Delete a line: Type dd in normal mode to delete the current line. To delete multiple lines, specify the range. For example, to delete lines 1 to 3, type :1,3d and press Enter. Tips for Efficient Line NavigationMany users overlook the Home and End keys on their keyboards. These keys are particularly useful for quickly jumping to the beginning or end of a line: Press Home to jump to the start of the current line. Press End to jump to the end. These shortcuts are available on Linux, Windows, macOS, and within Vim itself, making navigation and editing faster. Keep practicing these Vim commands and you’ll improve your efficiency in no time.

Have You Heard “大石碎胸口”?","text":"🎶 This Song’s Lyrics Will Shock You! Have You Heard “大石碎胸口”? Have you ever listened to a song that left you completely stunned by its lyrics? Today, I want to recommend a song that has stayed with me for years — “大石碎胸口” from the album by 万能青年旅店 (Wan Nian Qing Nian Lv Dian). Even though the song was released 13 years ago, every time I listen to it, it still resonates deeply. You don’t want to miss it. 🎧 Why Can’t I Stop Listening to This Song?“大石碎胸口” has a unique charm that makes it hard to resist. The first time you hear it, you might think it’s a little different from the usual songs you’re used to — it’s not a melody that makes you feel instantly happy, but rather one that gives you a heavy yet powerful feeling. The song blends rock, folk, and experimental music, and the arrangement stays with you, echoing in your ears long after the song ends. When you listen to it, you might feel a kind of pressure, almost as if a stone is pressing against your chest — and this feeling ties directly to the meaning behind the title, but there’s so much more depth to it. 🎤 How Powerful Are the Lyrics?Once you pay close attention to the lyrics, you’ll realize how much deeper they go than ordinary songs. The “大石” (big stone) and “胸口” (chest) in the title are symbols of life’s burdens and the place where we carry these struggles. Every line of the lyrics reflects the reality of life, describing the confusion, struggles, and resilience of ordinary people in the face of societal change. The lyrics “黑暗好像一颗巨石按在胸口” (The darkness feels like a giant stone pressing on my chest) make me stop and think every time I hear them — is this the “stone” we all carry at some point in our lives? This song opens a window to a hidden world, not just about an individual’s feelings, but also subtly reflecting the immense societal pressures people face. The more you listen, the more you’ll start to uncover the layers of meaning behind the words. 🎶 The Unique Charm of the MusicThe arrangement and performance of this song are impeccable. It’s more than just a rock song — it’s an emotional release. Each instrument is used so skillfully, from the trumpet and violin to the electric guitar and bass, all weaving together to create a layered sound that amplifies the emotional intensity of the song. Especially during the climax, the music pulls you into a deep, resonating world that makes you feel the emotions within the lyrics. 💭 Lyrics Excerpt 漁王還想 繼續做漁王而海港已經 不知去向此刻他醉倒 在洗浴中心沒有潮汐的夢胸口已暮色蒼茫 肥胖的城市 遞給他一個傳統的方法 來克制恐慌賣掉武器 風暴喉嚨換取飲食背叛能讓你獲得自由 停電之後 暫時擺脫了堅硬的時刻 倒轉的河肥胖的城市驅趕著所有 拒絕沉沒的人那首瘋狂的歌又響起 電燈熄滅 物換星移 泥牛入海黑暗好像 一顆巨石 按在胸口獨腳大盜 百萬富翁 摸爬滾打黑暗好像 一顆巨石 按在胸口 📢 Final Thoughts: Are You Ready to Experience This Powerful Combination of Weight and Strength?If you haven’t heard “大石碎胸口” yet, now is the time to give it a listen. This song is not just music, it’s a deep reflection on life, and a call to face the struggles and pressures we all experience.
