You can check and remove all the domain names bound to that IP address. Domain Name Service Provider Cache Not ClearedSometimes, the cache of domain name service provider is not cleared in time, resulting in the IP address still redirecting to the domain name. Please contact your service provider to clear the cache. URL rewrite rules on the server are not modifiedURL rewrite rules on the server (e.g. Nginx or Apache .htaccess files) may not be modified to the correct address, resulting in IP addresses still redirecting to the domain name. Example: Checking and tuning with Cloudflare Open Cloudflare website，go into DNS Records page, check to see if there are any other domains bound to your server’s IP address, and make sure that all extraneous domain records have been deleted. Go to Cache - Configuration - Clear Cache and select Clear All to make sure the cache has been cleared. Open your Nginx configuration file and make sure you have changed the bound domain name to an IP address. This way, your IP URL will open properly. The above solution is based on a public IP address with port 80 already open.","categories":[{"name":"website","slug":"website","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/categories/website/"}],"tags":[{"name":"website","slug":"website","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/tags/website/"}]},{"title":"How to connect to a server remotely using SSH in Google Cloud","slug":"Google-Cloud-SSH Remote Tutorials","date":"2024-08-26T02:17:30.000Z","updated":"2024-09-25T03:25:30.951Z","comments":true,"path":"Google-Cloud-SSH Remote Tutorials/","link":"","permalink":"https://en.pw0n.xyz/Google-Cloud-SSH%20Remote%20Tutorials/","excerpt":"Open this URL https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.htmlFind puttygen.exe (a RSA and DSA key generation utility), if you can’t find it, you can just Ctrl + F and type puttygen.exe (a RSA and DSA key generation utility).will automatically jump to the information you are looking for, for example, my is the chrome browser search is orange to remind the target found Find your corresponding computer architecture type download x86 on download x86","text":"Open this URL https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.htmlFind puttygen.exe (a RSA and DSA key generation utility), if you can’t find it, you can just Ctrl + F and type puttygen.exe (a RSA and DSA key generation utility).will automatically jump to the information you are looking for, for example, my is the chrome browser search is orange to remind the target found Find your corresponding computer architecture type download x86 on download x86 Download and open the software to enter Click Generate (tips: after clicking do not switch to other programs and wait a while to switch to other programs it will not move!)Generate a good need to add the information in front of the Gmail in the Key comment @ in front of, for example, mine is rsa-key-20240826test (in addition to your gmail in front of the information, For example my email is :test@gmail.com @ in front of, for example, test you directly add the back on the line) Then click Save private Key to save it to the folder you want.Then open your Google cloud Computer Engine and click “Metadata” in Settings and then click SSH secret key.Copy all the contents of puttygen’s Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized keys file: into the private key.
